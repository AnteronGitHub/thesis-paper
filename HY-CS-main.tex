%% History:
%% May 2019 Tomi Männistö, Antti-Pekka Tuovinen proofreading; 30 vs. 40 cr theses, etc.
%% May 2019 Tomi Männistö changed from babelbib to bibtex; Abstract page (and other pages as well) reformatting.
%% January–May 2019 several issues fixed by Niko Mäkitalo; long fields in abstract
%% March 2018 template file extended by Lea Kutvonen to exploit HYthesisML.cls.
%% Feb2018 This template file for the use of HYgraduML.cls was  modified by Veli Mäkinen from HY_fysiikka_LuKtemplate.tex
%% authored by Roope Halonen ja Tomi Vainio in 2017.
%% Some text is also inherited from engl_malli.tex versions by Kutvonen, Erkiö, Mäkelä, Verkamo, Kurhila, and
%% Nykänen, to accompany tktltiki.cls (by Puolakka 2002).

%% maxcitenames=2 -> only 2 author names in text citations, if more -> et al. is used
%% maxbibnames=99 as no great need to suppress the biliography list in a thesis
%% for more information see biblatex package documentation, e.g., from https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex

\begin{abstract}

Nowadays the Internet is being used as a platform for providing a wide variety
of different services. That has created challenges related to scaling IT
infrastructure management. Cloud computing is a popular solution for scaling
infrastructure, either by building a self-hosted cloud or by using cloud
platform provided by external organizations. This way some the challenges
related to large scale can be transferred to the cloud administrators.

OpenStack is a group of open-source software projects for running cloud
platforms. It is currently the most commonly used software for building private
clouds. Since initially published by NASA and Rackspace, it has been used by
various organizations such as Walmart, China Mobile and Cern nuclear research
institute. The largest production deployments of OpenStack clouds consist of
thousands of physical server computers located in multiple datacenters.

The OpenStack community has created many deployment methods that take advantage
of automated software configuration management. The deployment methods are
built with state of the art software for automating different administrative
tasks. They take different approaches to automating infrastructure management
for OpenStack.

This thesis compares some of the automated deployment methods for OpenStack and
examines the benefits of using automation for configuration management. We
present comparisons based on technical documentations as well as reference
literature. Additionally, we conducted a questionnaire for OpenStack
administrators about the use of automation. Lastly, we tested one of the
deployment methods in a virtualized environment.
