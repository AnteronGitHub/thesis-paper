Lots of persons circulating in PTL positions i various projects. I get the impression that not straying to far from the big vendors Red Hat (currently in symbiosis with tripleo) or Ubuntu (not very well in symbiosis with openstack-charms?) would be risk mitigation for a small organization. For a larger organization with long experience i guess assessing said project vitality and choosing the weapon of choice could be the path forward. For giants rolling your own would perhaps also makes sense."
